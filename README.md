# Rainydays

**Description / Purpose:**  
Rainydays is an e-commerce webpage dedicated to selling jackets for outdoor use. It was my second course assignment at Noroff and the very first website I built. The project tested my ability to convert a Figma design into a functional multipage web application using semantic HTML and modular CSS.

## Project Brief Highlights

- **Multipage Structure:**  
  The site includes every page listed in the site architecture provided by the assignment brief.

- **Semantic HTML:**  
  The HTML is semantic, neatly formatted, and valid.

- **DRY CSS:**  
  CSS follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, making the styles easy to read and maintain.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  The website is responsive and looks good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Flexbox and CSS Grid were used where appropriate (without using a framework like Bootstrap).

- **Accessibility:**  
  The site is WCAG compliant, with accessibility taken into account throughout the design.

- **Unique Meta Data:**  
  Each page has a unique `<meta name="description">`, `<title>`, and `<h1>`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Semantic and accessible markup.
- **CSS3** – Custom styles without a framework.


## Learning Experience

This was my first encounter with responsive web design. I had a lot of fun working on it, and it was a tremendous learning experience that helped me understand flexible layouts and accessibility best practices.
