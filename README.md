Rainydays is an e-commerce webpage for selling jackets designed for outdoor use. This project served as my first course assignment at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media and marked my initial foray into web development by transforming a Figma design into a functional, multipage web application.

## Description

Rainydays is a simple, multipage website that demonstrates the following:

- **Responsive Design:** The site is built to look great on all devices using vanilla HTML and CSS.
- **Semantic Markup:** HTML is structured semantically, is neatly formatted, and validated to ensure accessibility.
- **Custom Styling:** CSS is written following the DRY principle and utilizes modern layout techniques such as Flexbox and CSS Grid.
- **Interactive Elements:** Minimal JavaScript is used to mimic dynamic functionality (e.g., simulating login behavior and interactive transitions).

**Assignment Brief Highlights:**

- The site includes every page listed in the provided site architecture.
- Each page has unique `<meta name="description">`, `<title>`, and `<h1>` tags.
- The website is WCAG compliant and accessible.
- No external CSS frameworks were used—this project was built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
